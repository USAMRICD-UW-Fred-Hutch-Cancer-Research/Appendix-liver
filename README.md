# Appendix-liver
Care and treatment methods for persons without livers


The appendix liver processes liver functions at the post-stomache stage of calorie consumption. The appendix liver proccesses regurgitation and vomiting.

The appendix liver produces strong chlorine known as stomache bile. The appendix liver can be grown and developed into a second full-size liver via consumption of Beets, radish, collagen, calcium, magnesium, MSM, Biotin, and fiber.

A full size appendix liver in a person missing a liver will induce vomiting as a method of removing solid waste from the body. Feces will be vomited from the mouth without a liver.

Stomache pain associated with eating beets is a result of immediate growth and stretching of the appendix. Collagen allows for growth without tearing.
